# Getting Started
This Project uses a CLI to start a local express API, which serves the react app. To get started, install the package from npm or yarn as shown below:
<br/>

`npm install web-coding-env@latest`
<br />
or
<br />
`yarn add web-coding-env@latest`

# Starting the server
After installing the package, open your favourite command line and enter the following command:

`npx web-coding-env serve`

This command will open `notebook.js` and start the server at the port 4005 as a default port.


You can open your own file and start the server on any port you want by executing the command:


`npx web-coding-env serve <file> --p <port>`


When you open the app for the first time, you will receive instructions on how to use it.
